title: $:/plugins/paulsweeney/recipebook/Readme

This is a set of small widgets I've developed to keep a small recipe journal. Importantly, they use the `attribution`, and `attributionTitle` fields to render a link at the top of any tiddler with a matching tag. Similarly, a `rating` field is used to draw a series 5 stars, and the value of the rating field is used to highlight between 0 and 5 stars.

Additionally, you can set the rating automatically by clicking one of the star icons.
